      A personal security detail (PSD) refers to a team of highly trained professionals tasked with ensuring the safety and protection of an individual, typically a high-profile person such as a public figure, celebrity, government official, or corporate executive. The detail is designed to provide both proactive and reactive security measures in various environments, adapting to the specific risks and needs of the person being protected.

      <br><br>BTF Security Consulting Inc. realizes the importance of feeling secure walking from your place of employment or simply taking your evening jog.  BTF Security Consulting Inc. is structured to provide our clients with the peace of mind knowing they are safe when threats are lurking.  Our comprehensive approach uses the following guidelines to provide the highest level of personal safety.  The PSD begins with a thorough evaluation of potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to determine the necessary level of protection. This includes assessing current security, possible threats (e.g., harassment, kidnapping, or physical harm), and creating a comprehensive security plan. Finally, our professional Personal Security Detail personnel are highly trained in evasive driving, tactical responses, and crowd control, they are always close to the individual they are protecting. They ensure that the protected person is shielded from physical danger while being discreet and unobtrusive in public.
